Repository with my small Garmin Connect IQ projects.

## Digital_WatchFace ##
Simple digital watch face that displays the time, date and battery %.
TODO: Add Bluetooth, notification icons (only when active).

## Rest_Interval_Timer ##
For those like me that don't like having their standing/walking rest included in their run but still need to keep track of it.
A simple data screen app that starts a timer when the activity timer is stopped. Allows you to check your rest time but not record it. Resets back to 0 when the activity timer starts again.
